                    </br>
                    At the risk of being a big cornball, I'm just this once going to try to explain the role your advice has played in my life over the past year and show a dash of my gratitude. </br>
                    </br> My life up until this point has been relatively void of meaningful career/success guidance and after just a few conversations with you this past winter I have given myself an opportunity to completely change my life projectory in less than a year. I know to you it was little more than a simple suggestion, but wow if it hasn't made a impact so profound that's hard to even wrap my mind around. Your guidance came at a point where I was pretty damn lost and it was 100% a combination of my mom's support and your phone calls that got me back on track. In that, I hope you can enjoy watching as I carve out a new life of hard work, success, and absolute happiness and take pride knowing the role you played in my transformation. </br>

                    </br>
                    Thank you so much for the hospitality over the weekend. Hanging around in your beautiful house and eating so much delicious food was definitely the perfect little final boost of motivation I needed before landing back here THE D, where errbody is hustlin' to make it out :) </br>
                    </br>
                    Holden's goatee aside, you and Scott have built such a beautiful little cool-ass family and spending time out there with ya'll was just so much fun. If all goes well here, I look forward to hosting ya'll back here where your roots are within a few years! Just don't forget the family guns ;) </br>
